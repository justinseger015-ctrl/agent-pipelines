# Agent Pipelines

A [Ralph loop](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) orchestrator for Claude Code.

Describe what you want to build, and Claude handles the rest: planning, task breakdown, and running loops in the background. You can attach to watch progress, spin up multiple loops at once, or chain them into pipelines.

**What you get:**
- Loops run in tmux, not your terminal. Attach, detach, let them run overnight.
- Multiple loops at once for parallel features.
- Planning workflow: PRD → tasks → implementation loop.
- Pipelines to chain loops together.
- Crash recovery with automatic resume.
- Session locking prevents duplicate runs.

**Core philosophy:** Fresh agent per iteration prevents context degradation. Two-agent consensus prevents premature stopping. Planning tokens are cheaper than implementation tokens.

## Build Your Own Stages

Agent Pipelines is also a framework for creating custom stage types. Each stage has:

- A **prompt** that tells Claude what to do each iteration
- A **termination strategy** that decides when to stop

Built-in termination strategies:

| Strategy | When it stops | Good for |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| `queue` | All tasks done (`bd ready` returns empty) | Implementation loops |
| `judgment` | Two agents agree quality plateaued | Refinement, review, elegance |
| `fixed` | After N iterations or agent requests stop | Brainstorming, documentation |

**Example:** You want a bug-fix loop that keeps finding and fixing bugs until it stops finding new ones. Create a stage with `termination: { type: judgment }`. Run it with max 15 iterations. It might stop at 7 when two consecutive runs agree there's nothing left to fix.

Scaffold a new stage in seconds:
```bash
/agent-pipelines:build-stage bugfix
```

This creates `scripts/stages/bugfix/` with a config and prompt template. Edit the prompt, pick your termination strategy, done.

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/hwells4/agent-pipelines

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install agent-pipelines@dodo-digital
```

## Dependencies

The plugin checks for these on startup:

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|------------|---------|---------|
| [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) | Background execution | `brew install tmux` or `apt install tmux` |
| [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) | Task management CLI | `brew install steveyegge/tap/bd` |
| [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) | JSON state management | `brew install jq` or `apt install jq` |

## Commands

### Primary Commands

```bash
/sessions          # Orchestration hub: plan, status, attach, kill
/work              # Run the work loop: implement tasks from beads
/refine            # Run refinement pipelines: improve plans and beads
/ideate            # Generate improvement ideas (one-shot)
```

### Loop Management

```bash
/sessions status       # Check all running loops
/sessions attach NAME  # Watch a loop live (Ctrl+b, d to detach)
/sessions kill NAME    # Stop a session
/sessions plan         # Plan a new feature (PRD → beads)
```

### Supporting Skills

```bash
/agent-pipelines:create-prd     # Generate product requirements document
/agent-pipelines:create-tasks   # Break PRD into executable beads
/agent-pipelines:build-stage    # Scaffold a new custom stage type
```

Or just talk to Claude naturally:

```
"I want to add user authentication to this app"
"Check on my running loops"
"Attach to the auth loop"
```

## How It Works

Run `/sessions` and tell Claude what you're working on:

1. **Planning phase**: Claude gathers context through adaptive questioning, generates a PRD, and breaks it into discrete tasks (beads)
2. **Loop launch**: Claude spawns a tmux session running the loop engine
3. **Iteration cycle**: Each iteration, a fresh Claude instance reads the progress file, picks a task, implements it, commits, and updates progress
4. **Completion**: When work is done (all tasks complete, or quality has plateaued), you get a desktop notification

```
You describe work → Claude plans → tmux loop spawns → Fresh Claude per task → Desktop notification
```

The loop runs **independently** of your Claude Code session. You can:
- Continue working on other things while loops run
- Attach to watch live progress (`/sessions attach`)
- Spin up multiple loops for parallel work
- Recover if Claude Code crashes—loops keep running in tmux

## Stage Types

The system includes eight stage types, each designed for a different phase of work:

| Stage | Purpose | Termination | Default Iterations |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **work** | Implement tasks from beads | queue | User-specified |
| **improve-plan** | Iteratively refine planning docs | judgment (2 consensus) | 5 |
| **refine-beads** | Improve task definitions and dependencies | judgment (2 consensus) | 5 |
| **elegance** | Deep exploration for simplicity | judgment (3 min, 2 consensus) | Until plateau |
| **idea-wizard** | Brainstorm improvements | fixed | 1 |
| **readme-sync** | Keep README aligned with code | fixed | 1 |
| **robot-mode** | Design agent-optimized interfaces | fixed | 3 |
| **research-plan** | Research-driven plan refinement | judgment (3 min, 2 consensus) | Until plateau |

### Work Stage

The primary stage for implementation. Each iteration:

1. Reads progress file for accumulated context
2. Lists available beads: `bd ready --label=pipeline/{session}`
3. Picks the next logical task (considering dependencies)
4. Claims it: `bd update {id} --status=in_progress`
5. Implements, tests, commits
6. Closes: `bd close {id}`
7. Appends learnings to progress file

Terminates when the beads queue is empty.

### Refinement Stages

Use `/refine` to polish plans and tasks before implementation:

```bash
/refine quick    # 3+3 iterations (fast validation)
/refine full     # 5+5 iterations (standard, default)
/refine deep     # 8+8 iterations (thorough)
/refine plan     # Only improve the plan
/refine beads    # Only improve the beads
```

Each iteration reviews the work critically, makes improvements, and writes a decision (continue/stop) to status.json. Stops when two consecutive agents agree quality has plateaued.

### Elegance Stage

Deep exploration for simplicity and elegance. Finds what can be simplified, removed, or recast for clarity:

- Reads AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md intensively
- Maps system architecture before judging pieces
- Launches subagents for deep dives into suspicious abstractions
- Searches for functions that could merge, abstractions serving no purpose, machinery solving non-existent problems

Uses ultrathinking for depth. Requires 3 minimum iterations before checking plateau, then 2 consecutive agents must agree to stop.

### Idea Wizard

Use `/ideate` to generate improvement ideas. The agent:

1. Analyzes your codebase and existing plans
2. Brainstorms 20-30 ideas across six dimensions (UX, performance, reliability, simplicity, features, DX)
3. Evaluates each: Impact (1-5), Effort (1-5), Risk (1-5)
4. Winnows to top 5 and saves to `docs/ideas-{session}.md`

Fixed iterations (default: 1). Multiple iterations push the agent to think differently.

### README Sync Stage

Keeps README aligned with actual codebase:

1. Reads CLAUDE.md as authoritative source
2. Explores codebase for implemented features
3. Compares code vs README for each feature
4. Identifies gaps: missing, outdated, under-explained, under-justified
5. Edits README directly with clear descriptions, usage examples, and rationale

Single iteration by default.

### Robot Mode Stage

Designs CLI interfaces optimized for coding agent ergonomics:

- Identifies friction points that waste agent tokens
- Finds human-oriented formatting (colors, spinners, ASCII art)
- Documents missing machine-readable output options
- Prioritizes improvements by impact-to-effort ratio

Runs 3 iterations by default, each analyzing different areas.

### Research Plan Stage

Research-driven plan refinement using external sources:

1. Chooses ONE research focus per iteration (external repos, local models, tools, architecture)
2. Conducts focused research using WebFetch and WebSearch
3. Documents findings in progress file
4. Applies findings to plan with concrete changes

Uses judgment termination (3 min, 2 consensus). Each iteration must return with specific, actionable findings.

## How Plateau Detection Works

The `judgment` termination strategy requires **N consecutive agents to agree** before stopping (default: 2). This prevents single-agent blind spots.

### The Algorithm

1. **Minimum iterations gate**: Must reach `min_iterations` (default: 2) before checking consensus
2. **Current decision check**: Read the latest agent's status.json for `decision: stop`
3. **Backward scan**: Count consecutive "stop" decisions from most recent backward
4. **Consensus check**: If consecutive stops >= `consensus` (default: 2), terminate

```
Iteration 1: decision=continue
Iteration 2: decision=continue
Iteration 3: decision=stop      → 1 consecutive, need 2, continue
Iteration 4: decision=stop      → 2 consecutive, consensus reached, STOP
```

### Why This Matters

```
Agent 1: "decision: stop - plan covers all requirements"
Agent 2: "decision: continue - missing error handling section"  ← counter resets
Agent 3: "decision: stop - added error handling, plan complete"
Agent 4: "decision: stop - confirmed, nothing to add"  ← loop stops
```

No single agent can prematurely stop a loop. Both must independently confirm the work is done. This prevents:
- Single-agent blind spots
- Premature stopping on subjective quality judgments
- False confidence from one agent's limited analysis

### Configuration

Stages configure consensus requirements in `stage.yaml`:

```yaml
termination:
  type: judgment
  min_iterations: 2    # Don't check before this many iterations
  consensus: 2         # Consecutive stops needed
```

The `elegance` and `research-plan` stages use `min_iterations: 3` to ensure thorough exploration before allowing early termination.

## Pipelines

Chain multiple loops in sequence with pipelines:

```yaml
# pipelines/full-refine.yaml
name: full-refine
description: Complete planning refinement

steps:
  - loop: improve-plan
    max: 5

  - loop: refine-beads
    max: 5
```

Available pipelines:
- `quick-refine` - 3+3 iterations
- `full-refine` - 5+5 iterations
- `deep-refine` - 8+8 iterations

```

### Loop Configuration

Each stage type is defined by a `stage.yaml`:

```yaml
name: work
description: Implement features from beads until done
completion: beads-empty       # Stopping strategy
check_before: true            # Check before iteration starts
delay: 3                      # Seconds between iterations
```

For plateau-based loops:

```yaml
name: improve-plan
completion: plateau
min_iterations: 2             # Don't check plateau before this
output_parse: plateau:PLATEAU reasoning:REASONING
```

## State Management

The plugin creates files in your project (not the plugin directory):

```
your-project/
├── docs/
│   └── plans/                        # PRDs
│       └── 2025-01-09-auth-prd.md
├── .claude/
│   ├── pipeline-progress/
│   │   └── progress-auth.txt         # Accumulated context
│   ├── pipeline-state-auth.json          # Iteration history
│   └── pipeline-completions.json         # Completion log
└── .beads/                           # Task database
```

### Progress Files

Each iteration appends to the progress file:

```
# Progress: auth

Verify: npm test && npm run build

## Codebase Patterns
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## 2025-01-09 - auth-123
- Implemented JWT validation middleware
- Files: auth/middleware.js, auth/utils.js
- Learning: Token expiry needs graceful handling
---
```

Fresh agents read this file to maintain context without degradation.

### State Files

JSON files track iteration history for completion checks:

```json
{
  "session": "auth",
  "loop_type": "work",
  "started_at": "2025-01-09T10:00:00Z",
  "status": "running",
  "iteration": 5,
  "history": [
    {"iteration": 1, "timestamp": "...", "plateau": false},
    {"iteration": 2, "timestamp": "...", "plateau": true}
  ]
}
```

## Multi-Session Support

Run multiple loops simultaneously. Each has isolated beads, progress, state, and tmux session:

```bash
pipeline-auth      # beads tagged pipeline/auth
pipeline-dashboard # beads tagged pipeline/dashboard
```

## Notifications

When a loop completes:
- **macOS**: Native notification center
- **Linux**: `notify-send` (requires `libnotify`)

All completions logged to `.claude/pipeline-completions.json`.

## Environment Variables

Loops export these for hooks and prompts:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_PIPELINE_AGENT` | Always `1` when inside a loop |
| `CLAUDE_PIPELINE_SESSION` | Current session name |
| `CLAUDE_PIPELINE_TYPE` | Current stage type |

## Limitations

Loops run locally in tmux. If your machine sleeps, they pause. Use a keep-awake utility for overnight runs.
