# Agent Pipelines

Run Claude in a loop until the job is done.

The problem with long-running agents is context degradation. As the conversation grows, quality drops. Agent Pipelines fixes this with [Ralph loops](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/): each iteration spawns a fresh Claude that reads a progress file. Iteration 50 is as sharp as iteration 1.

Loops run in tmux. Start one, close your laptop, check back tomorrow.

## Build Your Own Stages

A stage is a prompt plus a termination strategy. That's it.

```yaml
# scripts/stages/bugfix/stage.yaml
name: bugfix
termination:
  type: judgment    # stop when 2 agents agree
  consensus: 2
```

Three termination types:

| Type | Stops when | Use for |
|------|------------|---------|
| `queue` | Task queue empty | Implementation |
| `judgment` | N agents agree to stop | Refinement, review |
| `fixed` | N iterations done | Brainstorming |

Scaffold a new stage:
```bash
/agent-pipelines:build-stage bugfix
```

Edit the prompt, run it. The framework handles iteration, state, crash recovery, and knowing when to stop.

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/hwells4/agent-pipelines

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install agent-pipelines@dodo-digital
```

## Dependencies

The plugin checks for these on startup:

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|------------|---------|---------|
| [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) | Background execution | `brew install tmux` or `apt install tmux` |
| [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) | Task management CLI | `brew install steveyegge/tap/bd` |
| [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) | JSON state management | `brew install jq` or `apt install jq` |

## Commands

### Primary Commands

```bash
/sessions          # Orchestration hub: plan, status, attach, kill
/work              # Run the work loop: implement tasks from beads
/refine            # Run refinement pipelines: improve plans and beads
/ideate            # Generate improvement ideas (one-shot)
```

### Loop Management

```bash
/sessions status       # Check all running loops
/sessions attach NAME  # Watch a loop live (Ctrl+b, d to detach)
/sessions kill NAME    # Stop a session
/sessions plan         # Plan a new feature (PRD → beads)
```

### Supporting Skills

```bash
/agent-pipelines:create-prd     # Generate product requirements document
/agent-pipelines:create-tasks   # Break PRD into executable beads
/agent-pipelines:build-stage    # Scaffold a new custom stage type
```

Or just talk to Claude naturally:

```
"I want to add user authentication to this app"
"Check on my running loops"
"Attach to the auth loop"
```

## How It Works

```
/sessions → describe work → PRD + tasks created → loop runs in tmux → done
```

Each iteration: fresh Claude reads progress file → picks task → implements → commits → updates progress. Loop stops when queue empties or agents agree quality plateaued.

Loops run independently. Attach to watch (`/sessions attach`), run multiple in parallel, close your terminal—they keep going.

## Built-in Stages

**work** — Grinds through your task queue. Each iteration picks a task, implements it, commits, closes it. Stops when queue is empty. This is the main implementation loop.

**improve-plan** — Reviews your PRD and makes it better. Runs until two agents in a row say "this is good enough." Use before breaking a plan into tasks.

**refine-beads** — Same idea, but for tasks. Splits tasks that are too big, merges ones that are too small, fixes dependencies. Run after `improve-plan`.

**elegance** — Hunts for unnecessary complexity. Looks for abstractions that don't earn their keep, functions that should merge, machinery solving non-problems. Run when your codebase feels bloated.

**idea-wizard** — Brainstorms 20-30 ideas, scores them by impact/effort/risk, picks top 5. Run when you're stuck or want fresh perspective.

**readme-sync** — Compares your codebase to the README and fills gaps. Run after long dev workflows to keep docs current.

**robot-mode** — Audits your CLI for agent-friendliness. Finds human-oriented output (colors, spinners) that wastes tokens. Run if you're building tools agents will use.

**research-plan** — Hits the web to improve your plan. Each iteration picks one research focus, finds concrete answers, applies them. Run when your plan needs external validation.

## How Plateau Detection Works

The `judgment` termination strategy requires **N consecutive agents to agree** before stopping (default: 2). This prevents single-agent blind spots.

### The Algorithm

1. **Minimum iterations gate**: Must reach `min_iterations` (default: 2) before checking consensus
2. **Current decision check**: Read the latest agent's status.json for `decision: stop`
3. **Backward scan**: Count consecutive "stop" decisions from most recent backward
4. **Consensus check**: If consecutive stops >= `consensus` (default: 2), terminate

```
Iteration 1: decision=continue
Iteration 2: decision=continue
Iteration 3: decision=stop      → 1 consecutive, need 2, continue
Iteration 4: decision=stop      → 2 consecutive, consensus reached, STOP
```

### Why This Matters

```
Agent 1: "decision: stop - plan covers all requirements"
Agent 2: "decision: continue - missing error handling section"  ← counter resets
Agent 3: "decision: stop - added error handling, plan complete"
Agent 4: "decision: stop - confirmed, nothing to add"  ← loop stops
```

No single agent can prematurely stop a loop. Both must independently confirm the work is done. This prevents:
- Single-agent blind spots
- Premature stopping on subjective quality judgments
- False confidence from one agent's limited analysis

### Configuration

Stages configure consensus requirements in `stage.yaml`:

```yaml
termination:
  type: judgment
  min_iterations: 2    # Don't check before this many iterations
  consensus: 2         # Consecutive stops needed
```

The `elegance` and `research-plan` stages use `min_iterations: 3` to ensure thorough exploration before allowing early termination.

## Pipelines

Chain multiple stages in sequence. Each stage's outputs become inputs for the next:

```yaml
# pipelines/full-refine.yaml
name: full-refine
description: Complete planning refinement - plan first, then beads

stages:
  - name: improve-plan
    stage: improve-plan
    runs: 5

  - name: refine-beads
    stage: refine-beads
    runs: 5
    inputs:
      from: improve-plan
      select: latest
```

Available pipelines:
- `quick-refine` - 3+3 iterations (fast validation)
- `full-refine` - 5+5 iterations (standard)
- `deep-refine` - 8+8 iterations (thorough)

### Running Pipelines

```bash
# Run a multi-stage pipeline
./scripts/run.sh pipeline full-refine.yaml my-session

# Run a single-stage pipeline (3 equivalent ways)
./scripts/run.sh work auth 25                    # Shortcut
./scripts/run.sh loop work auth 25               # Explicit
./scripts/run.sh pipeline --single-stage work auth 25  # Engine syntax
```

### Pipeline Schema

Pipelines support inline prompts, perspectives for fan-out, and stage references:

```yaml
name: multi-review
stages:
  - name: review
    runs: 4
    perspectives:
      - security
      - performance
      - maintainability
      - testing
    prompt: |
      Review from ${PERSPECTIVE} perspective.
      Write to ${OUTPUT}

  - name: synthesize
    runs: 1
    prompt: |
      Combine all reviews:
      ${INPUTS.review}
      Write synthesis to ${OUTPUT}
```

See `scripts/pipelines/SCHEMA.md` for the complete schema reference.

## Architecture

**Everything is a pipeline.** The unified engine (`engine.sh`) runs all sessions the same way. A single-stage pipeline is what we colloquially call a "loop."

### Stage Configuration

Each stage type is defined by a `stage.yaml`:

```yaml
name: work
description: Implement features from beads until done

termination:
  type: queue                 # queue, judgment, or fixed

delay: 3                      # Seconds between iterations
```

For judgment-based stages:

```yaml
name: improve-plan
description: Iteratively refine planning docs

termination:
  type: judgment
  min_iterations: 2           # Don't check consensus before this
  consensus: 2                # Consecutive stops needed

delay: 2
```

For fixed-iteration stages:

```yaml
name: idea-wizard
description: Brainstorm improvements

termination:
  type: fixed                 # Runs exactly N times, or until agent writes decision: stop

delay: 1
```

### v3 Status Format

Agents write `status.json` at the end of each iteration:

```json
{
  "decision": "continue",       // or "stop" or "error"
  "reason": "Found more work",
  "summary": "Implemented auth middleware",
  "work": {
    "items_completed": ["beads-abc123"],
    "files_touched": ["src/auth.ts"]
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

The engine reads this to determine:
- Whether to continue (for judgment/fixed types)
- What to record in state history
- Whether an error occurred

### Template Variables

Prompts use variables that are resolved at runtime:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `${CTX}` | Path to `context.json` with full iteration context |
| `${PROGRESS}` | Path to progress file |
| `${STATUS}` | Path where agent writes `status.json` |
| `${ITERATION}` | 1-based iteration number |
| `${SESSION_NAME}` | Session name |
| `${OUTPUT}` | Path to write output (multi-stage pipelines) |
| `${INPUTS}` | Previous stage outputs (multi-stage pipelines) |
| `${PERSPECTIVE}` | Current item from perspectives array (fan-out) |

The `context.json` provides complete iteration context:

```json
{
  "session": "auth",
  "pipeline": "loop",
  "stage": { "id": "work", "index": 0, "template": "work" },
  "iteration": 3,
  "paths": {
    "session_dir": ".claude/pipeline-runs/auth",
    "progress": ".claude/pipeline-runs/auth/progress-auth.md",
    "status": ".claude/pipeline-runs/auth/.../iterations/003/status.json"
  },
  "inputs": { "from_stage": {}, "from_previous_iterations": [] },
  "limits": { "max_iterations": 25, "remaining_seconds": -1 }
}
```

## State Management

All sessions run in `.claude/pipeline-runs/{session}/` with unified state tracking:

```
your-project/
├── docs/
│   └── plans/                                    # PRDs
│       └── 2025-01-09-auth-prd.md

└── .beads/                                       # Task database
```

### Progress Files

Each iteration appends to the progress file:

```markdown
# Progress: auth

Verify: npm test && npm run build

## Codebase Patterns
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## 2025-01-09 - auth-123
- Implemented JWT validation middleware
- Files: auth/middleware.js, auth/utils.js
- Learning: Token expiry needs graceful handling
---
```

Fresh agents read this file to maintain context without degradation. This is the core of the Ralph loop pattern: each agent is fresh (no token accumulation), but reads accumulated learnings from previous iterations.

### State Files

JSON files track iteration history for completion checks and crash recovery:

```json
{
  "session": "auth",
  "type": "loop",
  "started_at": "2025-01-09T10:00:00Z",
  "status": "running",
  "iteration": 5,
  "iteration_completed": 4,
  "iteration_started": "2025-01-09T10:05:00Z",
  "history": [
    {
      "iteration": 1,
      "timestamp": "2025-01-09T10:00:30Z",
      "decision": "continue",
      "summary": "Implemented user model"
    },
    {
      "iteration": 2,
      "timestamp": "2025-01-09T10:01:00Z",
      "decision": "continue",
      "summary": "Added login endpoint"
    }
  ]
}
```

Key fields:
- `iteration_completed`: Last iteration that fully finished (safe resume point)
- `iteration_started`: When current iteration began (crash detection)
- `history`: Array of all iteration outcomes for plateau detection

## Session Management

### Multi-Session Support

Run multiple pipelines simultaneously. Each has isolated beads, progress, state, and tmux session:

```bash
pipeline-auth      # beads tagged pipeline/auth
pipeline-dashboard # beads tagged pipeline/dashboard
```

### Session Locking

Locks prevent running duplicate sessions with the same name. They are automatically released when a session ends normally or its process dies.

```bash
# List active locks
ls .claude/locks/

# View lock details (PID, start time)
cat .claude/locks/{session}.lock | jq

# Check if a session is locked
test -f .claude/locks/{session}.lock && echo "locked" || echo "available"

# Clear a stale lock manually (only if process is dead)
rm .claude/locks/{session}.lock

# Force start despite existing lock
./scripts/run.sh work my-session 10 --force
```

**When you see "Session is already running":**
1. Check if the PID in the lock file is still alive: `ps -p <pid>`
2. If alive, the session is running - attach or kill it first
3. If dead, the lock is stale - use `--resume` to continue or `--force` to restart

### Crash Recovery

Sessions automatically detect and recover from crashes (API timeouts, network issues, SIGKILL).

**When a session crashes**, you'll see:
```
Session 'auth' failed at iteration 5/25
Last successful iteration: 4
Error: Claude process terminated unexpectedly
Run with --resume to continue from iteration 5
```

**To resume:**
```bash
./scripts/run.sh work auth 25 --resume
```

**How crash detection works:**
1. On startup, engine checks: lock exists + PID dead = crashed
2. State file tracks `iteration_started` and `iteration_completed` for precise resume
3. For hung sessions (PID alive but stuck), use `tmux attach` to diagnose

**What gets preserved on crash:**
- Iteration history (all completed iterations in `state.json`)
- Progress file (accumulated learnings in markdown)
- Completion checkpoint (`iteration_completed` marks the safe point)
- Error context (what went wrong)

**What gets reset on resume:**
- Status returns to "running"
- Error details cleared
- Loop continues from `iteration_completed + 1`

## Debugging

```bash
# Watch a running pipeline
tmux attach -t pipeline-{session}

# Check pipeline state
cat .claude/pipeline-runs/{session}/state.json | jq

# View progress file
cat .claude/pipeline-runs/{session}/progress-{session}.md

# Check remaining beads
bd ready --label=pipeline/{session}

# Check iteration status
cat .claude/pipeline-runs/{session}/stage-*/iterations/*/status.json | jq

# Kill a stuck pipeline
tmux kill-session -t pipeline-{session}

# Check session status (active, failed, completed)
./scripts/run.sh status {session}
```

## Notifications

When a loop completes:
- **macOS**: Native notification center
- **Linux**: `notify-send` (requires `libnotify`)

All completions logged to `.claude/pipeline-completions.json`.

## Environment Variables

Loops export these for hooks and prompts:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_PIPELINE_AGENT` | Always `1` when inside a loop |
| `CLAUDE_PIPELINE_SESSION` | Current session name |
| `CLAUDE_PIPELINE_TYPE` | Current stage type |

## Validation & Linting

Before running a pipeline, validate your configuration:

```bash
# Lint all stages and pipelines
./scripts/run.sh lint

# Lint a specific stage
./scripts/run.sh lint loop work

# Lint a specific pipeline
./scripts/run.sh lint pipeline full-refine
```

The validator checks for common mistakes:

**Stage validation (L-codes):**
| Code | Check |
|------|-------|
| L001 | Stage directory exists |
| L002 | stage.yaml present |
| L003 | Valid YAML syntax |
| L004 | name field present |
| L005 | name matches directory (warning) |
| L006 | termination.type present |
| L007 | termination type maps to valid strategy |
| L008 | prompt.md exists |
| L009 | judgment loops have consensus config |
| L010 | min_iterations >= 2 for judgment (warning) |
| L011 | template variables are known |

**Pipeline validation (P-codes):**
| Code | Check |
|------|-------|
| P001 | Pipeline file exists |
| P002 | Valid YAML syntax |
| P003 | name field present |
| P004 | stages array present and non-empty |
| P005 | Each stage has name |
| P006 | Stage names are unique |
| P007 | Each stage has `stage` or `prompt` |
| P008 | Referenced stages exist |
| P009 | INPUTS references point to valid stages |
| P010 | First stage doesn't use INPUTS (warning) |
| P011 | Each stage has runs field (warning) |

### Dry Run Preview

Preview what a pipeline will do without executing:

```bash
# Preview a stage
./scripts/run.sh dry-run loop work my-session

# Preview a pipeline
./scripts/run.sh dry-run pipeline full-refine my-session
```

Dry run shows:
- Validation results (pass/fail with all warnings)
- Configuration values (termination strategy, delay, consensus)
- File paths that will be created
- Resolved prompt with template variables substituted
- Termination conditions

## Testing Framework

Agent Pipelines includes a testing framework for development and CI:

### Mock Execution Mode

Test pipeline execution without calling the Claude API:

```bash
# Enable mock mode with fixtures
MOCK_MODE=true ./scripts/run.sh work test-session 5
```

Mock mode:
- Uses fixture files instead of Claude API
- Supports iteration-specific responses (`iteration-1.txt`, `iteration-2.txt`)
- Falls back to `default.txt` for missing iterations
- Generates valid status.json automatically
- Configurable simulated delay (`MOCK_DELAY=2`)

### Fixture Structure

Each stage can have fixtures for testing:

```
scripts/stages/work/
├── stage.yaml
├── prompt.md
└── fixtures/
    ├── default.txt           # Fallback response
    ├── iteration-1.txt       # Response for iteration 1
    ├── iteration-2.txt       # Response for iteration 2
    ├── status.json           # Default status template
    ├── status-1.json         # Status for iteration 1
    └── status-2.json         # Status for iteration 2
```

### Creating Fixtures

Generate fixture sets for different termination types:

```bash
# Plateau fixtures (for judgment stages)
source scripts/lib/mock.sh
create_fixture_set "improve-plan" "plateau"

# Work fixtures (for queue stages)
create_fixture_set "work" "beads-empty"
```

### Recording Mode

Capture real Claude responses to create fixtures:

```bash
source scripts/lib/mock.sh
enable_record_mode "work"
# Run the pipeline normally
# Responses saved to fixtures/recorded/{timestamp}/
```

### Test Assertions

The test framework provides assertions for pipeline testing:

```bash
source scripts/lib/test.sh

run_test "State file created" test_state_file
test_state_file() {
  assert_file_exists "$run_dir/state.json"
  assert_json_field "$run_dir/state.json" ".status" "running"
  assert_json_field_exists "$run_dir/state.json" ".history"
}

test_summary  # Prints results, returns exit code
```

Available assertions:
- `assert_eq`, `assert_neq` - Value equality
- `assert_file_exists`, `assert_file_not_exists`
- `assert_dir_exists`
- `assert_json_field`, `assert_json_field_exists`
- `assert_contains`, `assert_not_contains`
- `assert_exit_code`
- `assert_true`, `assert_false`

## Design Philosophy

### Everything Is A Pipeline

The unified engine treats all executions identically. A "loop" is just a single-stage pipeline. This simplifies the codebase and mental model:

```
Single-stage: ./scripts/run.sh work auth 25
Multi-stage:  ./scripts/run.sh pipeline full-refine.yaml auth
```

Both create the same directory structure, state files, and lock management. The engine doesn't distinguish between them—it just runs stages sequentially.

### The Abstraction Hierarchy

```
Pipeline (YAML config)
  └── Stage (stage.yaml + prompt.md)
        └── Iteration (single Claude call)
              └── Status (status.json decision)
```

**Pipeline**: Configuration that chains stages together. Can be single-stage (loop) or multi-stage.

**Stage**: A prompt template paired with a termination strategy. Defines what Claude does each iteration and when to stop.

**Iteration**: One Claude invocation. Fresh agent reads progress file, does work, writes status.json.

**Status**: Agent's decision about what happened (continue/stop/error) and what to do next.

### Termination as a First-Class Concept

Termination strategies are pluggable shell scripts in `scripts/lib/completions/`:

```bash
# beads-empty.sh - Queue termination
# Returns 0 (done) if bd ready returns no results

# plateau.sh - Judgment termination
# Returns 0 (done) if N consecutive agents wrote decision: stop

# fixed-n.sh - Fixed termination
# Returns 0 (done) after N iterations OR if agent writes decision: stop
```

Each strategy receives the session context and iteration history. Adding a new strategy is as simple as creating a new shell script that returns 0 when done.

### Progress Files as Compressed Context

The progress file is the key to the Ralph loop pattern. It compresses hours of work into pages of context that fresh agents can read quickly.

**What goes in:**
- Codebase patterns discovered during work
- Learnings from each iteration
- Verify commands that should pass
- Cross-cutting concerns

**What stays out:**
- Raw conversation history
- Debugging dead-ends
- Redundant information

Each iteration appends a dated section. Fresh agents scan the file to understand prior work without token accumulation.

### Consensus Over Single Judgment

For subjective quality decisions (is the plan good enough?), requiring multiple agents to agree prevents:

- Single-agent blind spots
- Premature stopping on false confidence
- Missing obvious improvements

The backward scan algorithm counts consecutive "stop" decisions. If the count reaches the consensus threshold (default: 2), the loop terminates. Any "continue" resets the count.

## Planning Workflow

Agent Pipelines supports a structured planning-to-implementation flow:

### 1. Create PRD

Use `/agent-pipelines:create-prd` or `/sessions plan`:

```
You: "I want to add user authentication"
```

Claude conducts adaptive questioning to gather requirements:
- What auth methods? (email/password, OAuth, magic link)
- Session management approach?
- Required security features?
- Integration points?

### 2. Break Into Tasks

Use `/agent-pipelines:create-tasks`:

Claude reads the PRD and creates beads:
- Discrete, implementable tasks
- Dependency relationships
- Labels for the session (`pipeline/{session}`)
- Priority ordering

### 3. Refine (Optional)

Use `/refine` to polish before implementation:

```bash
/refine quick    # 3+3 iterations
/refine full     # 5+5 iterations (default)
/refine deep     # 8+8 iterations
```

First stage refines the plan document. Second stage refines the beads. Both use judgment termination—stops when quality plateaus.

### 4. Implement

Use `/work` to run the implementation loop:

```bash
/work auth 25    # Run work loop, max 25 iterations
```

Each iteration:
1. Fresh Claude reads progress file
2. Lists available beads
3. Picks next logical task
4. Implements, tests, commits
5. Closes bead, updates progress

Loop terminates when all beads are done.

## Limitations

Loops run locally in tmux. If your machine sleeps, they pause. Use a keep-awake utility for overnight runs.
