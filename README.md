# Loop Agents

A [Ralph loop](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) orchestrator for Claude Code.

Describe what you want to build, and Claude handles the rest: planning, task breakdown, and running loops in the background. You can attach to watch progress, spin up multiple loops at once, or chain them into pipelines.

**What you get:**
- Loops run in tmux, not your terminal. Attach, detach, let them run overnight.
- Multiple loops at once for parallel features.
- Planning workflow: PRD → tasks → implementation loop.
- Pipelines to chain loops together.

## Build Your Own Loop Agents

Loop Agents is also a framework for creating custom loop types. Each loop agent has:

- A **prompt** that tells Claude what to do each iteration
- A **completion strategy** that decides when to stop

Built-in completion strategies:

| Strategy | When it stops | Good for |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| `beads-empty` | All tasks done | Implementation loops |
| `plateau` | Two agents agree quality plateaued | Refinement, bug hunting |
| `fixed-n` | After N iterations | Brainstorming, batch processing |
| `all-items` | After processing each item | Review loops |

**Example:** You want a bug-fix loop that keeps finding and fixing bugs until it stops finding new ones. Create a loop with `completion: plateau`. Run it with max 15 iterations. It might stop at 7 when two consecutive runs agree there's nothing left to fix.

Scaffold a new loop in seconds:
```bash
/loop-agents:build-loop bugfix
```

This creates `scripts/loops/bugfix/` with a config and prompt template. Edit the prompt, pick your completion strategy, done.

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/hwells4/loop-agents

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install loop-agents@dodo-digital
```

## Dependencies

The plugin checks for these on startup:

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|------------|---------|---------|
| [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) | Background execution | `brew install tmux` or `apt install tmux` |
| [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) | Task management CLI | `brew install steveyegge/tap/bd` |
| [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) | JSON state management | `brew install jq` or `apt install jq` |

## Commands

### Primary Commands

```bash
/loop              # Orchestration hub: plan, status, attach, kill
/work              # Run the work loop: implement tasks from beads
/refine            # Run refinement pipelines: improve plans and beads
/ideate            # Generate improvement ideas (one-shot)
```

### Loop Management

```bash
/loop status       # Check all running loops
/loop attach NAME  # Watch a loop live (Ctrl+b, d to detach)
/loop kill NAME    # Stop a session
/loop plan         # Plan a new feature (PRD → beads)
```

### Supporting Skills

```bash
/loop-agents:create-prd     # Generate product requirements document
/loop-agents:create-tasks   # Break PRD into executable beads
/loop-agents:build-loop     # Scaffold a new custom loop type
```

Or just talk to Claude naturally:

```
"I want to add user authentication to this app"
"Check on my running loops"
"Attach to the auth loop"
```

## How It Works

Run `/loop` and tell Claude what you're working on:

1. **Planning phase**: Claude gathers context through adaptive questioning, generates a PRD, and breaks it into discrete tasks (beads)
2. **Loop launch**: Claude spawns a tmux session running the loop engine
3. **Iteration cycle**: Each iteration, a fresh Claude instance reads the progress file, picks a task, implements it, commits, and updates progress
4. **Completion**: When work is done (all tasks complete, or quality has plateaued), you get a desktop notification

```
You describe work → Claude plans → tmux loop spawns → Fresh Claude per task → Desktop notification
```

The loop runs **independently** of your Claude Code session. You can:
- Continue working on other things while loops run
- Attach to watch live progress (`/loop attach`)
- Spin up multiple loops for parallel work
- Recover if Claude Code crashes—loops keep running in tmux

## Loop Types

The plugin includes four loop types, each designed for a different phase of work:

| Loop | Purpose | Stops When |
|------|---------|------------|
| **work** | Implement tasks from beads | All beads are complete |
| **improve-plan** | Iteratively refine planning docs | Two agents agree quality has plateaued |
| **refine-beads** | Improve task definitions and dependencies | Two agents agree beads are implementable |
| **idea-wizard** | Brainstorm improvements | Fixed iteration count |

### Work Loop

The primary loop for implementation. Each iteration:

1. Reads progress file for accumulated context
2. Lists available beads: `bd ready --label=loop/{session}`
3. Picks the next logical task (considering dependencies)
4. Claims it: `bd update {id} --status=in_progress`
5. Implements, tests, commits
6. Closes: `bd close {id}`
7. Appends learnings to progress file

### Refinement Loops

Use `/refine` to polish plans and tasks before implementation:

```bash
/refine quick    # 3+3 iterations (fast validation)
/refine full     # 5+5 iterations (standard, default)
/refine deep     # 8+8 iterations (thorough)
/refine plan     # Only improve the plan
/refine beads    # Only improve the beads
```

Each iteration reviews the work critically, makes improvements, and outputs a plateau assessment.

### Idea Wizard

Use `/ideate` to generate improvement ideas. The agent:

1. Analyzes your codebase and existing plans
2. Brainstorms 20-30 ideas across six dimensions (UX, performance, reliability, simplicity, features, DX)
3. Evaluates each: Impact (1-5), Effort (1-5), Risk (1-5)
4. Winnows to top 5 and saves to `docs/ideas.md`

## How Plateau Detection Works

The `plateau` completion strategy requires **two consecutive agents to agree** before stopping. This prevents single-agent blind spots.

```
Agent 1: "PLATEAU: true - plan covers all requirements"
Agent 2: "PLATEAU: false - missing error handling section"  ← counter resets
Agent 3: "PLATEAU: true - added error handling, plan complete"
Agent 4: "PLATEAU: true - confirmed, nothing to add"  ← loop stops
```

No single agent can prematurely stop a loop. Both must independently confirm the work is done.

## Pipelines

Chain multiple loops in sequence with pipelines:

```yaml
# pipelines/full-refine.yaml
name: full-refine
description: Complete planning refinement

steps:
  - loop: improve-plan
    max: 5

  - loop: refine-beads
    max: 5
```

Available pipelines:
- `quick-refine` - 3+3 iterations
- `full-refine` - 5+5 iterations
- `deep-refine` - 8+8 iterations

```

### Loop Configuration

Each loop type is defined by a `loop.yaml`:

```yaml
name: work
description: Implement features from beads until done
completion: beads-empty       # Stopping strategy
check_before: true            # Check before iteration starts
delay: 3                      # Seconds between iterations
```

For plateau-based loops:

```yaml
name: improve-plan
completion: plateau
min_iterations: 2             # Don't check plateau before this
output_parse: plateau:PLATEAU reasoning:REASONING
```

## State Management

The plugin creates files in your project (not the plugin directory):

```
your-project/
├── docs/
│   └── plans/                        # PRDs
│       └── 2025-01-09-auth-prd.md
├── .claude/
│   ├── loop-progress/
│   │   └── progress-auth.txt         # Accumulated context
│   ├── loop-state-auth.json          # Iteration history
│   └── loop-completions.json         # Completion log
└── .beads/                           # Task database
```

### Progress Files

Each iteration appends to the progress file:

```
# Progress: auth

Verify: npm test && npm run build

## Codebase Patterns
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## 2025-01-09 - auth-123
- Implemented JWT validation middleware
- Files: auth/middleware.js, auth/utils.js
- Learning: Token expiry needs graceful handling
---
```

Fresh agents read this file to maintain context without degradation.

### State Files

JSON files track iteration history for completion checks:

```json
{
  "session": "auth",
  "loop_type": "work",
  "started_at": "2025-01-09T10:00:00Z",
  "status": "running",
  "iteration": 5,
  "history": [
    {"iteration": 1, "timestamp": "...", "plateau": false},
    {"iteration": 2, "timestamp": "...", "plateau": true}
  ]
}
```

## Multi-Session Support

Run multiple loops simultaneously. Each has isolated beads, progress, state, and tmux session:

```bash
loop-auth      # beads tagged loop/auth
loop-dashboard # beads tagged loop/dashboard
```

## Notifications

When a loop completes:
- **macOS**: Native notification center
- **Linux**: `notify-send` (requires `libnotify`)

All completions logged to `.claude/loop-completions.json`.

## Environment Variables

Loops export these for hooks and prompts:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_LOOP_AGENT` | Always `1` when inside a loop |
| `CLAUDE_LOOP_SESSION` | Current session name |
| `CLAUDE_LOOP_TYPE` | Current loop type |

## Limitations

Loops run locally in tmux. If your machine sleeps, they pause. Use a keep-awake utility for overnight runs.
